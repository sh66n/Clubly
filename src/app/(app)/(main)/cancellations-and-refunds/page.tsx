        SHAAN SAMEER EDROOS believes in helping its customers as far as
        possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this
        policy: Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made
        within Not Applicable of placing the order. However, the cancellation
        request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to
        the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping
        them. SHAAN SAMEER EDROOS does not accept cancellation requests for
        perishable items like flowers, eatables etc. However, refund/replacement
        can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of product
        delivered is not good. In case of receipt of damaged or defective items
        please report the same to our Customer Service team. The request will,
        however, be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the
        same at his own end. This should be reported within Not Applicable of
        receipt of the products. In case you feel that the product received is
        not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it
        to the notice of our customer service within Not Applicable of receiving
        the product. The Customer Service Team after looking into your complaint
        will take an appropriate decision. In case of complaints regarding
        products that come with a warranty from manufacturers, please refer the
        issue to them. In case of any Refunds approved by the SHAAN SAMEER
        EDROOS, it’ll take Not Applicable for the refund to be processed to the
        end customer.
